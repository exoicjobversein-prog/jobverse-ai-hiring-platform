## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Redis (for Celery + Django Channels)
- PostgreSQL (or SQLite for quick dev)

---

### Step 1 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GautamSutar/JobVerse-AI.git
cd JobVerse-AI
```

---

### Step 2 — Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside `backend/` with the following:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
DEBUG=True

# Database (use SQLite for quick local dev, or Neon PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3

# Google Gemini AI
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key

# Email (SMTP via Gmail)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com

# Redis (for Celery + Channels)
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
CHANNEL_LAYERS_REDIS=redis://localhost:6379/1

# Cloudinary (Media Storage)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

---

### Step 3 — Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate     # Mac/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# (Optional) Load sample aptitude questions
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/aptitude_questions.json

# Start the Django/Daphne ASGI server
python manage.py runserver
```

Backend runs at: **http://localhost:8000**

---

### Step 4 — Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Start Vite dev server
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at: **http://localhost:5173**

---

### Step 5 — Celery Worker (Required for AI Tasks)

AI resume screening, interview question generation, and answer evaluation all run asynchronously via Celery. Start the worker in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate
celery -A core worker -l info --pool=solo   # Windows
# celery -A core worker -l info             # Mac/Linux
```

> **Note:** Redis must be running before starting Celery and Django Channels. Install Redis locally or use a cloud Redis instance.

## 📝 Advanced AI Proctoring & Anti-Cheat

The Full Readiness Test and category-specific tests operate under a strict, automated AI proctoring environment:

### AI Detection Engine (TensorFlow.js `coco-ssd`)
- **Object Detection:** Continuously scans the webcam feed. If a **Cell Phone** or **Multiple Persons** are detected, the test triggers a 'Severe' violation and auto-submits.
- **Face Tracking:** Triggers a warning if the candidate's face drops out of frame for 10 seconds. Accumulating 5 "No Face" strikes auto-submits the test.

### Audio & Hardware Monitoring
- **Noise Detection:** Analyzes FFT frequencies via `AudioContext`. If loud background noise or alternative voices are sustained for 4 seconds, it triggers a 'Severe' violation and auto-submits.
- **Hardware Disconnects:** Actively listens to `MediaStream` tracks. If a user unplugs or software-disables their microphone/camera mid-test, it auto-submits.

### Suspicious Action "Strike" System
- **Fullscreen Enforced:** Test starts in mandatory fullscreen. Exiting is a strike.
- **Tab Switching & Visibility:** Navigating away from the window is a strike.
- **Shortcut & Clipboard Blocking:** Right-clicks, Dragging, Snipping Tool (`Win+Shift+S`), and MacOS screenshots are suppressed or logged as strikes. Copying/Pasting text is disabled and counts as a strike.
- **3-Strike Limit:** All minor Suspicious Actions share a unified pool. Hitting 3 strikes auto-submits the test.

### Comprehensive Logging Dashboard
- End-of-test Result Dashboards dynamically render a comprehensive JSON log of every intervention.
- Includes exact infraction Timestamps, Warning/Severe severity tags, and descriptive reasons for each flag instead of simple numeric counts.

## 🐳 Docker (Optional)

A `docker-compose.yml` is included for containerized setup:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## 📖 Git & Development Notes

- `venv/`, `.env`, and `node_modules/` are all git-ignored — see `.gitignore`.
- Always activate your Python virtual environment before running backend commands.
- The Celery worker **must** be running for any AI feature to work (resume screening, interview generation, aptitude evaluation).
- Django Channels / Daphne handles all WebSocket connections (community chat, video call signaling, game matchmaking).
- Media files (uploaded resumes) are stored via Cloudinary.
