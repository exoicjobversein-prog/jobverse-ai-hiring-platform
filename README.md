# JobVerse 🚀

**JobVerse** is an AI-powered hiring ecosystem that automates the recruitment lifecycle. From resume screening to technical interviews and real-time evaluation, JobVerse leverages the **Gemini AI API** to provide deep insights into candidate potential while ensuring integrity through WebSocket-based proctoring.

## 🔄 Project Flow: The Hiring Journey

The application follows a structured path for both recruiters and candidates:

### 1. Job Creation (HR)
- **Recruiter** posts a job with specific technical requirements, secondary skills, and experience levels.
- The **AI Engine** prepares to use these requirements as the benchmark for evaluation.

### 2. Application & AI Resume Screening (Student)
- **Candidate** uploads their resume and applies for a job.
- **Asynchronous Task (Celery):** The resume is parsed and compared against the job description using Gemini AI.
- **Result:** HR sees a "Resume Match Score" and a summary of strengths/weaknesses before even opening the file.

### 3. Interview Scheduling (HR)
- HR reviews the AI-screened candidates and clicks **Schedule AI Interview**.
- An automated email is sent to the candidate with the scheduled time.

### 4. The AI Interview Session (Student)
- **Real-time Interaction:** The candidate enters a dedicated interview interface. 
- **Dynamic Questioning:** Instead of fixed questions, the AI generates technical challenges based on the job requirements and the candidate's specific resume.
- **Live Proctoring:** The system monitors for suspicious activity (tab switching, copy-pasting) via WebSockets.

### 5. Automated Evaluation & Reporting
- Each answer is evaluated by AI for technical accuracy and depth.
- Upon completion, a **Final Report** is generated containing:
    - Overall Technical Score
    - Detailed Strengths & Weaknesses
    - Hiring Recommendation (e.g., "Proceed to Final Round")
- HR receives an email notification with the summary.

## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

### 1. Prerequisite Setup
- **Clone the Repo:** `git clone https://github.com/GautamSutar/JobVerse-AI.git`
- **Environment:** Create a `.env` in the root (see `.env.example`).

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
# Use the venv Python to run the server
.\venv\Scripts\python manage.py runserver
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Celery Worker (Required for AI Tasks)
```bash
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate
celery -A core worker -l info --pool=solo
```
